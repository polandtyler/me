# User Manual: Tyler Poland

## Who I am

**Call me Tyler.** 

ðŸ‘‹  

My pronouns are he/him.

## How I operate (tl;dr):

**My preferred communication method** is asynchronous - i.e. IM or email.

**"Flow" times are important.**  I block out large swaths of my day to focusing on development, but in reality my work flows in 60-90 minute [ultradian rhythms](https://www.fastcompany.com/3013188/why-you-need-to-unplug-every-90-minutes) - so feel free to message me and I will get back to you within 1.5 hours at the most.

## **Philosophy**

First and foremost, I do not believe that people have concrete and immutable personality traits. How you and I act in any given situation is highly specific to that scenario's context, as well as the version of ourselves that we bring to that context. 

With that disclaimer, I will try my best to outline how I behave at the extremes:

***At my best, I...***
- seek to be transparent and vulnerable
- am thoughtful and deliberate
- ask a lot of open-ended questions
- am comfortable challenging the accepted norms
- use _a lot_ of emojis

***At my worst, I...***
- feel like an imposter
- go with the status quo
- have a hard time focusing
- withold information
- also use _a lot_ of emojis

## Quirks
Like you, I also have some. They are:

#### **I frown when I'm thinking**  
If you see me with a disconcerted look on my face, it probably means that I am puzzling something out internally and not that I am upset. Joyful is my default state, I promise. ðŸ™‚

#### **I prefer Why/How over What**
 If you tell me something, oftentimes my first questions are probably going to be "how does that work?" and/or "why this way?". Some people can find this approach argumentative, but I find that it is the best way for me to understand.

#### **Growth through opposition** 
Experience has taught me that _respectful_ argument is one of the best innovation tools we have at our disposal. To this end, I often find myself playing the role of devil's advocate. If you present an idea and I seem bent on proving you wrong, please do not take it personally. There's a very good chance that I actually agree with you.

#### **Transparency is King** 
In software (and life), hidden states create inefficiencies. I do not believe that overcommunication is a real thing. I will take open, awkward "TMI" moments over veiled pleasantries every day of the week (and twice on Sunday).

## **Et cetera**

Some random non-work interests I have:
- Dogs (all of them; I've never met one I wasn't absolutely in love with)
- Caffeine (any form)
- Neurobiology
- Playing supporting roles
- PC games with deep tech trees and massive grind requirements - Valheim, 7 Days to Die, Medieval Dynasty, etc
- Hard sci-fi books/movies
- Music that pushes speakers to their limit - filthy dubstep, metal, and so on
- Political philosophy
