# User Manual: Tyler Poland

## Who I am

**Call me Tyler.** - but I would also answer to TP, TyPo, or really any other clever moniker you may like to bestow upon me.

**I frown when I'm thinking.** If you see me with a disconcerting look on my face, it probably means that I am puzzling something out internally and not that I am upset. Joyful is my default state, I promise. ðŸ™‚

**I am an introvert.** My energy levels dissipate in large groups, and are refilled via alone time and meaningful 1-1 conversations. While in a low-energy state I can be a bit grumpy, so it's important that I take the requisite time to recover between IRL or "video-on" meetings.

**I prefer Why/How over What.** If you tell me something, my first questions are probably going to be "how does that work?" and/or "why this way?". Some people can find this approach argumentative, but I find that it is the best way for me to understand.

**I believe in growth through opposition.** Experience has taught me that _respectful_ argument is one of the best innovation tools we have at our disposal. To this end, I often find myself playing the role of devil's advocate. If you present an idea and I seem bent on proving you wrong, please do not take it personally. There's a very good chance that I actually agree with you.

**I like transparency.** In software (and life), hidden state creates inefficiencies. I do not believe that overcommunication is a real thing. I will take open, awkward "TMI" moments over veiled pleasantries every day of the week (and twice on Sunday).


## How I operate
**My preferred communication method** is asynchronous - i.e. IM or email.

**"Flow" times are sacred.** Oftentimes I have found it beneficial for my work to go heads-down for long durations. I try my best to represent these times in Slack. If you see a "heads-down" status/emoji combo it means that I probably won't respond immediately, but will get back to you ASAP.
